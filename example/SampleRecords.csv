"09/03/2020","CE-0512060","Complaint","Building-Mold","New","Online-RKL-We currently are leasing 4775 Lamont St in Pacific Beach and move out on Sep 7th. There are a couple of items we'd like to report on this home before we leave. The first, and most concerning issue, is the presence of mold. In the showers, near the front door, under the staircase, and in the downstairs bedroom. My roommate has multiple handbags and shoes ruined because they have been found covered in the mold during our packing process. Under the staircase, there is a strong odor of mildew and we have found damp items underneath that we originally had placed in there for storage.  We are now questioning if the presence of mold has had any effect on our personal health as some of us have been experiencing symptoms of mold exposure.The second issue is the staircase. The stairs are relatively small and uneven in size (I'm unsure the code standards on stairs) but they are certainly not up to code. This past year by roommate fell on the staircase and fractured her tailbone (which she needed to be taken to the hospital for) and had to endure the effects of.The third and final issue is the sewage for all of the units in our area has come up in the downstairs shower multiple times now and gets drained through our backyard in a hole. We were unaware upon signing the lease that the sewage hole was in our backyard and there was any potential to have backlogged items come up next to our grass.We move out in a couple of days so there's not much we'd like to change going forward. We'd like to know if and what actions can be taken against the mold and if we need to be concerned about our health/personal items. Second, we'd like to make the city aware that this home (built-in 1901 may I add) could potentially get turned around and leased out to a new group who is going to be completely unaware of these issues. If someone is unavailable to come look at the property before we move out, we'd strongly encourage someone to follow up with our landlord to see if he makes any of the necessary changes. Please feel free to contact us with any questions, again we are looking for guidance and any recommendations the city has at this point.",

Impossible for pedestrians to see or be seen when crossing the street from this corner, and impossible to cross street from opposite direction and access sidewalk by crossing parkway. I was almost hit by a car today crossing here, and since this has occurred multiple times due to this landscaping, I am requesting something be done about it. These plants also prevent anybody parking infront of this parkway from getting out of their passenger side door due to placement of large plants. Owner has even taken to blocking portion of sidewalk that runs from curb, across parkway, to main sidewalk by training a palm to grow on top of it, blocking the sidewalk.   This needs addressed for obvious safety reasons. I am all for the beautification and upkeep of parkways, but in a manner that doesn’t block citizens from doing simple things like crossing the street safely or getting out of their vehicle. I was under the impression you needed a permit to develop parkways, and clearly no one would approve this. The intentions of the homeowner are clear. He has landscaped the parkway like this to deter people from parking in front of his house or crossing the street in front of his house, even going so far to cover up public sidewalks.

There is water damage on the inside and outside of the apartment.  The issue has always been partially fixed. Due to it being an ongoing issue we have mold and the paint is peeling on various parts of the ceiling and also leads to the smell of humidity. We have reported this issue to the landlord but he did not properly repair the issue. They came and scraped and repainted the walls but the new paint continues to peel off and fall around the apartment. We have contacted the landlord about the issue but he refuses to make any more repairs. We have continued to pay our rent in time but he will not repair the problem. Talking to the neighbors I have found out that a few of them also have the same issues with water damage but are not comfortable asking for repairs for fear of getting their rent raised or of being asked to move out of their apartments.""",
