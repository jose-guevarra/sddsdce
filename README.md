# San Diego DSD Code Violations database

The purpose of this project is to create a more accessible source of property records 
for San Diego DSD Code Violations records. The City of San Diego uses a proprietary web
application to submit and provide access to various city violations e.g. barking dogs,
unpermitted structures, loud music. This project will allow you to:

- Download all records from the city's website
- Import/Update them into an SQL database
- Automate webscraping of APN information from the city website
- Allow some tools to export the database into csv format


 TODO:
 - Installation instructions
 - Sample database schema
 - Sample records
